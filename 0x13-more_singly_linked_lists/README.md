1: computes the length of a linked list
2: adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list
3: adds a new node at the end of a linked list

5: frees a linked list given a pointer to the head
6: deletes (frees) the first node, and establish the second node as first
7: returns the pointer to node at a given position n
8: sums the (numeric) data in nodes of a linked list
